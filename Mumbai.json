					"description" : "With a distance of approx 83 km from Mumbai, this is a perfect getaway for nature lovers. The name Matheran means either ‘Forest on Top’ or ‘Woodland overhead’. There are around 38 lookout points in this smallest hill station of India. Matheran, which means "forest on the forehead" (of the mountains) is an eco-sensitive region, declared by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Government of India.One can also find a great variety of medicinal herbs & plants. There are about 28 points, 2 lakes, 2 parks & 4 major worship places in Matheran.",
					"preferred mode of transport" : "Train",
					"nearest station" : "Neral",
					"Tips" : ["Get enough cash as there aren't many ATMs in Matheran", "Monkeys in Matheran are quite mischevious so avoid carrying eatables in hand and feeding the monkeys."]
					"How to reach": "You can travel through train from Mumbai to Neral. Only few trains like Deccan Express and Koyna Express stops at Neral. If you don't get into Neral trains, you can always take trains to Karjat and backtrack on frequent local trains to Neral. The total journey time is approximately 1 hours. The train fare ranges from 50 INR to 300 INR. From Neral a small Toy Train takes you through a zigzag route of about 21 kms. to Matheran(Memorial hall) in two hours time. The toy train can only be booked in advance from Mumbai or Pune which is a good idea in the high season (tickets go on sale 45 minutes before departure). The journey from Neral to Matheran is really pleasent. Various stations like Jumma Patti, Water Pipe and Aman Lodge are on the way to Matheran. ",
					"preferred local transport" : ["Horses and hand pulled rickshaws are popular mode of commution in Matheran. Horse rides are charged 100 INR per hour to lope around the view points.", "Trekkers delight: Energetic trek is from Neral to Dasturi gate. The distance from Neral to Dasturi gate is 8 km. It is a blissful walk where streams cut through farms. You won't find good network in that area, so it trekkers have to take help from the local people there for directions. You can rest and enjoy a snack midway at Janmapatti rail station where the road and track meet. There are a few eateries run by localities. Second leg of the trek is difficult than the first as the path gets steeper. Following the road should get you to Dasturi gate after which one has to take the unpaved trail till Matheran Bazaar. All trails in Matheran are well marked and getting around shouldn't be difficult. From Dasturi gate to Memorial hall, you can either trek or choose Horse Ride or Rickshaw."],
